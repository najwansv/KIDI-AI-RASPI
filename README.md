## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

KIDI AI is a computer vision system running on Raspberry Pi 5 that leverages HAILO AI acceleration for tasks such as face detection, recognition, depth estimation, and object classification. The system provides efficient AI processing at the edge using HAILO's neural processing unit.

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The system uses multiple AI models (located in the Model directory) optimized for the HAILO AI accelerator to process visual data. The main Python application coordinates these models to provide comprehensive AI-powered vision capabilities with significantly improved performance compared to CPU-only solutions.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
